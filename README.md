# 2DCT
2DCT with image

1. Call dctTwo.m to start the 2DCT process

2. NxN.m divides the image into NxN block and multiplied by the coefficients

3. DCTcoe.m generates the compressed/decompressed image

4. To recover the image, call IdctTwo.m

5. Decide the area of each block needed with Mask.m, then call DCTcoe.m

yiq.m and Iyiq.m can change the channels of RGB to YIQ, vice versa
